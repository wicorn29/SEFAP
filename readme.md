# Starfall Education Foundation Archival Project (SEFAP)

**Project Overview:**  
The **Starfall Education Foundation Archival Project (SEFAP)** is a database of educational content from the Starfall learning platform. It primarily consists of Flash files and other assets designed for children. All assets in this archive have been retrieved by **Wicorn29** and are preserved in their **original, unmodified state** as fetched from the Starfall servers.

## Notice

This archive contains content that was originally intended to be accessed by **paid subscribers of Starfall**. SEFAP is an **archival project** whose purpose is to preserve these educational materials in case they become unavailable online.  

Before accessing or using any subscription-based content, it is strongly recommended that you **support the Starfall Education Foundation by subscribing at [https://www.starfall.com](https://www.starfall.com)**. This ensures that you are complying with ethical and legal practices while still benefiting from the educational resources provided by Starfall.

## Important Notes

- Some modules may rely on dynamic data, such as the **avatar of the local character from the “Who Am I?” dataset**. Since this data is not included in SEFAP, these modules may behave erratically or malfunction.  
- For extracting assets or audio from Flash files, it is **highly recommended to use a Flash decompiler**, such as [FFDec (JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler)](https://www.free-decompiler.com/flash/).

## Content Overview

SEFAP contains:

- **Flash Animations (.swf)** – Interactive learning modules covering a variety of subjects.  
- **Audio and Images** – Assets used by the Flash modules for visual and auditory learning.  
- **Metadata Files** – Optional information to help locate or categorize content.  

All files are preserved exactly as retrieved from the original servers, without modification or enhancement.

## Dear Starfall,
This repository stands to also prove your systems to be obsolete and extremly insecure. I'd love to join your devteam as I know exactly how to reslove your security issues, but that's just me. Shoot me an email of you're interested.
